# TunePlay Desktop

The official TunePlay desktop application.

Some antivirus programs don't really like this program, because it isn't officially signed (yet). For now, while installing, it's best to disable your antivirus for a while.

I know it sounds a bit shady, but trust me - there's no malicious code in here.

Sounds like something malicious code would say? I know. Oops

But trust me please
