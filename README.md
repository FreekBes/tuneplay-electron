# TunePlay Desktop

The official TunePlay desktop application.

Some antivirus programs don't really like this program, because it isn't officially signed (yet). For now, while installing, it's best to disable your antivirus for a while.

**On Windows 10**, when the Smartscreen filter shows up, press 'More info' and then press 'Allow'.
