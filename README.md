# TunePlay Desktop

The official TunePlay desktop application.

Some antivirus programs don't really like this program, because it isn't officially signed (yet). For now, while installing, it's best to disable your antivirus for a while.

**On Windows 10**, when the Smartscreen filter shows up, press 'More info' and then press 'Allow'.

The liquidsoap.exe requesting access to your network details is part of the TunePlay Multiplayer feature (where you can listen together with your friends). It won't function without it, but if you wish not to use it, you can of course disallow access. It is not required for TunePlay itself to work.
